# odin-recipes
First assessment for The Odin Project

## The subject
I will allow myself to quote The Odin Project to describe what is the exact subject of this assignment:
> It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.
> The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design, that is.
> But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.*

## The goal
This is a website created to facilitate the knowledge gained during the HTML Basics part of The Odin Project. 

While most of the concepts taught in this part of the course are already familiar to me, I use it as a good opportunity to learn about the best practices in web design. And to really use the best practices, I belive that one should learn the basic ones first, which is often omitted at the begginning of the web developer journey, which was the case for me as well back in the day.

## Side goal
Web developers work is not only about coding, it is also about being proficient with the tools available, to make the coding part possibly a smooth and efficient task. The tools that I want to master using simple tasks as an occasion for it are:

 - Git and its workflow,
 - VSCode IDE,
 - Keyboard - yes, it's not a mistake. I try to learn touch typing for quite some time already. While it is still a difficult task for me, I already see the benefits of being able to focus my attention on the screen alone. It helps me coding faster, switching focus more efficiently, working with a CLI more confidently... and it's fun! Also, while Vim itself is at this point too much of a hussle for me, I find the Vim-like navigation addons in other IDE's a blessing!
