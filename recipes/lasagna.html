  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce
     and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made
      with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
       I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 pound grown pork</li>
    <li>1/2 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>onion</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of parsley</li>
    <li>one clove of garlic (crushed)</li>
    <li>dash of sugar</li>
    <li>dried basil, dried oregano, salt, black pepper</li>
    <li>noodles</li>
    <li>shredded mozzarella, cottage cheese and Parmesan</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. 
      Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned 
      tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano,
       and sugar.</li>
    <li>Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
    <li>Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, 
      the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce 
      and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
    <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. 
      Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
    <li>Cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be perfectly 
      baked in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes uncovered). </li>
  </ol>
